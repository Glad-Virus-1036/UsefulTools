Thank you for downloading UsefulTools! 

UsefulTools is currently on v1.0.3-alpha. I am still testing the program to see everything that could be enhanced. I'd love to hear your opinion, though, so please consider creating an issue at UsefulTools' Github page.

Below is a list of everything that's currently on the program.
- Shortkeys
- Clipboard
- Quick Converter
- Random Number Picker
- Changelog

Below are the explanations for everything that's currently on the program.

Shortkeys: With Shortkeys, you can write whole paragraphs in the press of a key. Simply select Shortkeys in the main menu, select Assign a Shortkey in the Shortkeys menu, and follow on-screen instructions. After that, when you use a Shortkey, it'll automatically write the text you put in it. You can create as many Shortkeys as you want and they're saved in a separate json file. More can be read in the Info section of Shortkeys.

Clipboard: Copy and paste, but more advanced. Add any text you want to the Clipboard. You can come back and check the Clipboard at any time. You can put as many text there as you want and it's saved in a separate json file.

Quick Converter: Converter. It converts units. Miles to meters. Hours to days. Celsius to fahrenheit.

Random Number Picker: Picks a random number.

Changelog: UsefulTools' changelog.

And that concludes the README file. I'll change it accordingly to what people say about it and the updates I make to UsefulTools.
Again, thank you for downloading!

Sincerely,
- Glad-Virus-1036
