UsefulTools is a program that contains various... useful tools. Use any of them as you wish. Not all of them may function as expected, and this project is still in alpha testing. And I still suck at programming. So please be patient for future updates. The project will become a .exe file soon (when I find out why pyinstaller isn't working).

Keep in mind that UsefulTools is still in alpha testing. That means I'm supposed to test everything out, and... well, yeah, I'm supposed to test everything out. Maybe I'll make a beta version... when I have the time.

Thank you for downloading!

Sincerely,
